- This is a model which accurately classifies pediatric chest X-ray images as having pneumonia or not.
- This model was trained on pediatric chest X-ray images and, through an iterative modeling approach, has achieved an overall accuracy of 92.82%, recall of 93.44%, and precision of 96.14%.
- This could be an important tool to reduce childhood mortality, especially in impoverished regions with less access to advanced healthcare systems.
